        <p class="class1">In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is.
            The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields.
            Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds". 
            Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts</p>
